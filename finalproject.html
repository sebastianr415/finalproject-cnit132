<h2 id = "secheading2">Roadmap</h2>
<p> 
My roadmap to becoming a full time front end started when covid 19 sweep the city. Having alot off time on my hands my oldest brother has introduce me to coding.
I then found a passion and career I really liked but never took it to seriously. In hopes of teaching myself succesfully I found myself stuck in tutorials. 
Endless amount reasource but cant figure out the next step but now i joined city college classes to get myself out of this repeatative loop.
