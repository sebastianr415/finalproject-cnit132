    <h2>Article 1</h2>
<p> My time in CNIT 132 I attended a meet up called San Francisco Web Development Club. The meetup was free which is awesome about the site <a href = "meetup.com">Meetup</a>
The site has endless amount of free or payment needed for the meetups. The Meet up that I attended had online events weekly,
meeting Mondays and Thursdays. Rain or shine the meetup was happening becausae it's virtual. The Meetup presentation and demonstrations are conducted via zoom  
The community inside the meetup foster a supportive and generous enviorment, in the community
they collaborativly explore a wide range of relevant internet technologies through indiviual meet ups. To name a few HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React , Node.js and of course Artifical Intelligence.

    <h3>Article 2</h3>
<p>The club's meetings were not same, they changed through out the week covering different subjects. The one I attended was titled
"An Introduction to Best Practices in Frontend Web Development". Bret Bernhoft the creator of the club started the meet up with a slideshow about 
his best practices to elevate frontend skills. The slides talked about optimizing css for performancedf, crafting user centric designs and scalable
and visualable web applacations. As well as specified examples of techniques and tools that can be applied to improve one's code.

    <h3>Article 3</h3>
<p>I was able to learn how to keep clean code with extensions from my editor or using my chrome developing tools.
Being able to properly clean my indentatons and when the indentatons was needed. We also talked about how to connect with devlopers with similar front end developer skills
or better. Cold calling with emails using inbox messages through social media for example linkedin, instagram or X(twitter). Being creative and curious about
coding will keep my learning fun and interactive. I left the club with connections/industry friends, sharing common mistakes or successful through out the journey of becoming 
a front end developer.
