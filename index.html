<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Sebastian Ramirez. Im a front dev in San Francisco, ca and I'm currently prusing a front-end developer <br>
certificate at San francisco city college. I took a step into this career because I find it entertaining. The amouunt of creativity is endless 
and the potential of the internets power is imppecable. Creating soultions to what the people of the internt need, virtually or in person.
</p>

<aside>
<p>   
My roadmap to becoming a full time front end started when covid 19 sweep the city. Having alot off time on my hands my oldest brother has introduce me to coding.
I then found a passion and career I really liked but never took it to seriously. In hopes of teaching myself succesfully I found myself stuck in tutorials. 
Endless amount reasource but cant figure out the next step but now i joined city college classes to get myself out of this repeatative loop.
